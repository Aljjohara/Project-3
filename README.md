# Project-3

Project spec:  Our REIT beleives the exodus from urban centera will continue and we want to expand our exposure suburban real estate.  To identify the most lucrative areas, we will use machine learning.  We plan to identify several key features, and then try an unsupervised clusterint method to bucket geographies to allow us to identify communities that are the most similar and thus may have similar market performance, or do supervised learning, predicting the change property value, and the potentiall most lucrative geographies will be identified based on our required RoI hurdle rate.

APIs used: Census, Redfin, Zillow.....

Machine Learning Models: RNN?, Affinity or mean-shift clustering (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html)
